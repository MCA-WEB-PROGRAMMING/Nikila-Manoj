            <h2><center><i>Master of Computer Application</i><b> 2021-2023</b></center></h2>
            <h2><u>Theory subjects</u></h2>
            <ul>
                    <li><h2><b>Mathematical Foundatin for Computing</b></h2></li>
                    <p><i>This course introduces students to some basic mathematical ideas and tools which are
                        at the core of MCA course. It introduces the concepts of graph theory, set theory and statistics.</i></p>
                        <li><h2><b>Digital Fundamentals and Computer Architecture</b></h2></li>
                        <p><i>The primary aim of this course is to understand the fundamentals behind the digital logic design
                            and gain the experience to design digital circuits and systems. Students should also acquire some
                            understanding and appreciation of a computer systemâ€™s functional components, their
                            characteristics, performance and interactions. They need to understand the computer architecture
                            in order to make best use of the software tools and computer languages they use to create programs.</i></p>
                            <li><h2><b>Advanced Data Structures</b></h2></li>
                            <p><i> A graduate course in Computer Applications should give due exposure to the recent
                                developments. Since Data structures is a central pillar of any program on Computer Science/
                                Applications, this course is designed to build upon the knowledge acquired at the undergraduate
                                level and familiarise students with a bunch of modern data structures which are quite useful to
                                solve, in the most effective manner, the modern, real life problems.</i></p>
                                <li><h2><b>Advanced Software Engineering</b></h2></li>
                                <p><i>Most of the programs on Computer Applications do not give due importance to teach Software
                                    Engineering in an Industry perspective. But this course, built upon the tools and techniques
                                    prevalent in Industry today, is supposed to make students Industry-ready.</i></p>
                <h2><u>Lab Practical Subjects</u></h2>
            <ul>
                    <li><h2><b>Python Programming</b></h2></li>
                    <p><i>This course introduces a basic step towards program writing and develops the logical
                        ability and problem-solving skill using Python Programming Language. Students are able to do
                        testing and debugging of code written in Python.</i></p>
                        <li><h2><b>Web Programming Lab</b></h2></li>
                        <p><i>With a dynamic learn-by-doing focus, this laboratory course encourages the
                            students to explore the designing of web application by implementing the relevant and
                            recent techniques. This course challenges the students to exercise their creativity in both
                            programming and designing.</i></p>
                            <li><h2><b>Data Structure Lab</b></h2></li>
                            <p><i>This is the companion course of 20MCA105 Advanced Data Structures and provides
                                the students hands-on experience of the advanced data structures which will boost up the
                                knowledge and confidence of students in applying these techniques while dealing with real life
                                computing problems.</i></p>
